#Project 1 

We planned to look at the FAFSA data grants by number of applicants, state, and school to find out how who was applied for aid and who actually received it. The approach that we were taking initially was too broad due to the incongruency of data we were able to find, and we needed to be more granular and asking a specific question given our approach. 

Instead, our team shifted our focus and examined position on the rankings from US News and World Report to see if there is a correlation with the local economy which was defined by the following characteristics: household income, per capita income, population, and poverty level.
